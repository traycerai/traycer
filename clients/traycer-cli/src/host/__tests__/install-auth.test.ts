// `maybeProvisionCredential`'s own decision logic, which had no direct
// coverage: every command suite that exercises it (`host-install`,
// `host-ensure`, `service-install`) mocks this function wholesale to pin its
// own wiring, so nothing tested what it decides.
//
// The decision it makes is a two-part gate - did this run START anything,
// and can we mint for it - and the second half deliberately does NOT trust
// the pre-flight's verdict. The pre-flight runs before a stage + install
// that can take minutes, and the credentials file moves in BOTH directions
// across that window: a concurrent `traycer login` in another terminal
// invalidates an `unauthenticated` verdict exactly as a concurrent sign-out
// invalidates a `signed-in` one. So the auth is re-read at probe time and
// the pre-flight's verdict survives only as the thing that decides what a
// still-missing credential MEANS.
//
// `resolveHostAuth` and `provisionInstalledHostCredential` are mocked: the
// real ones read the operator's actual `~/.traycer` credentials and open a
// WebSocket to a host. The probe's own internals have their own suite in
// `credential-provisioning.test.ts`.
